Nia, Remind Me!

An artificial intelligence project using C# programming language (Object-oriented programming).


Objectives :
1.	To design and develop intelligent voice recognition program with offline connectivity.

3.	To allow user to receive relevant information by voice command.

Project significant :
This system will be able to help user to manage their daily task and activities. 
Just say keyword ‘remind’ to make the system save your tasks on the spot using voice command. 
This system will not use the internet for reminding the user unless user want to use other speciality like playing song, asking some relevant information. 
As this system able to remind user, this includes the time, date, and day.
This could be a two-way communication as user give voice command in English language and the system will repeat it for confirmation and do the task as command.

This project has shown it's ability where it has been proposed to UTeM AI Innovation Challenge 2021 community.
